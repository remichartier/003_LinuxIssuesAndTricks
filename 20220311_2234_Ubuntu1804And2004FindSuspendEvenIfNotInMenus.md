# Ubuntu 18.04 + 20.04 : find Suspend even if not in menus

Trick:
- Click on Applications Icons in the dash bar (Left bar on Ubuntu)
- In the Search field, search : "suspend"
- Icon Suspend will be shown (icon with 2 vertical bars like for a Pause sign)
- This Icon/App can not be set as a Favorite, so everytime we want to use it, we need to search it.
- Click on it to trigger a Suspend/Sleep of your Ubuntu system.
