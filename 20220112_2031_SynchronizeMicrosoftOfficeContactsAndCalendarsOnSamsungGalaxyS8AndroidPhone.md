  - ` Easiest way to sync Outlook contacts with Android, get the Outlook app from the Google Play Store on your phone. Once it's open, Microsoft says you'll find a "Get Started" button and then an "Add Account" button that will have you input your work email address. Then tap "Continue."`

  - `Enter your password and tap "Sign In." The app will ask if you have any other email accounts to add. If not, you can tap "Maybe Later" to continue to sync your Exchange email account along with your calendar and contacts.`

  - `Next, Microsoft warns you'll need to tweak the Outlook Android sync settings to see your contacts on your phone's default contacts app rather than just inside Outlook's app. Access Outlook's menu, tap the gear icon at the bottom of the list, and locate your work email address within the list. Switch "Sync contacts" to the "on" position for your Outlook contacts to sync between the apps.`
