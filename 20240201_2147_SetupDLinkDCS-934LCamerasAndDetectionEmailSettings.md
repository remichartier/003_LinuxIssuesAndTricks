## Setup Camera email notifications using Windows / Internet Explorer / Camera html page

- D-Link does not support anymore those obsolete cameras, therefore login into the www.mydlink.com will indicate we need to use an obsolete Internet Explorer browser or an very old specific Firefox browser version to be able to connect to the camera.

- The URL www.mdlink.com, after login, will lead to this page: https://www.mydlink.com/device/unsupport_os_browser

Make legacy sites work in Microsoft Edge

Are you facing issues in opening legacy sites? With Internet Explorer mode, you can open legacy sites in Microsoft Edge. Select Add under Internet Explorer mode pages to add any legacy site to list of sites that will open automatically in Internet Explorer mode.

Allow sites to be reloaded in Internet Explorer mode (IE mode)  ---> TO BE SET TO "Allow".
When browsing in Microsoft Edge, if a site requires Internet Explorer for compatibility, you can choose to reload it in Internet Explorer mode

Internet Explorer mode pages --> WE CAN ADD URLs we want Edge to open with Internet Explorer Compatibility Mode.

These pages will open in Internet Explorer mode for 30 days from the date you add the page. You have 3 pages that'll automatically open in Internet Explorer mode.
