- Personally, I googled "Convert Image To Transparent Background Online", found https://onlinepngtools.com/create-transparent-png, a little difficult to understand and to use. But to succeed, in summary I did : 
  - Click on the transparency color field, then click on white background color I want to remove to just keep the signature ink.
  - Field "Match similar color field" --> 0%
  - And then I save the output image, consisting of only the pixels coming from the signature ink, and everything else will be transparent when using this signature image.
